<!-- 
## Notes

To install the [`@openzeppelin/contracts`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) contract library in a [`dapptools`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools) project, make sure to first add a `remappings.txt` file with the following contents:

```
@openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
ds-test/=lib/ds-test/src/
```

In addition to the `remappings.txt` file, add a `.dapprc` config file  with the following:

```
export DAPP_REMAPPINGS=$(cat remappings.txt)
export DAPP_LINK_TEST_LIBRARIES=0
``` 

Finally, install the package by running:

```
dapp install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```
